# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Overview
Using a NoSQL database, Start bein's Mongoose models sync with its MongoDB database and React components so it can easily scale exponentially.  Although a brand new start-up, we go beyond all talk, thoughts, and prayers. Start bein promotes activity within and contribution to to the world at home and abroad. So, stop talkin, start bein!

  ## Description
  * Did anyone else notice the animals venturing out into our locked down cities during the early days of Covid? What about the blue skies visible again in notoriously smoggy cities?
  * Social media apps have been a great resource for thinking, but what about being? We all know the cliche, "To be or not to be." Start bein advocates a balance between thinking and doing things as a way to start bein.
  * Let's face it, a safe place to pitch a topic or activity with the goal of positive "bein" by doing can only help balance the hardships broadcast daily.  It is not to ignore reality, but change a small part of your world one bein at a time. 
  * The best aspect of the code presented is that it builds both virtual and physical places to interact and make a difference. We use both external and internal data sources to promote the overall foundation of the app.
  * "It's not easy bein green as transformed.  Now it's about time to 'Start bein" in the world.

  ## Installation
  * As a full stack M-E-R-N application, there is no special installation required for the general us of the start-bein app. Technologies incorporated are a part of the thrird and final project of the six month odyssey of the full-stack bootcamp sponsored by the University of Miami:
  Use React for the front end.

>Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Include authentication (JWT).

Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
