Project 3
NOTES FROM MODULE 23

...build a performant and scalable MERN stack single-page application

 fulfills a real-world need, with a focus on data and user demand

combine a scalable 
	MongoDB back end, 
	a GraphQL API, and an 
	Express.js and 
	Node.js server with a 
	React front end

user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform.

agile development methodologies
	storing your project code in GitHub
	managing your work with a project management tool,
	implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

you should start from scratch


The requirements for this project ask you to use the skills and technologies you‚Äôve learned over
 the past six weeks, including the following:

Performant JavaScript
NoSQL databases
React single-page applications
GraphQL APIs
Concurrent servers in a MERN app
Authentication


Your project should fulfill the following requirements:

Use React for the front end.

Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Include authentication (JWT).

Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).


EXTRAS
CSS Styling
Instead of using a CSS library like Bootstrap, consider one of the following suggestions:

Look into the concept of CSS-in-JS, which abstracts CSS to the component level, using JavaScript to 
describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. Some popular libraries include styled-components
 (https://styled-components.com/) and Emotion (https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

Try using a component library, such as Semantic UI (https://semantic-ui.com/), 
Chakra UI (https://chakra-ui.com/), or Ant Design (https://ant.design/).

Create all the CSS for your application just using CSS.

Payment Platform
Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even if you don‚Äôt create an e-commerce application, 
you could set up your site to accept charitable donations.

Bonus
Although this is not a requirement for your project, see if you can also implement functionality to meet 
the minimum requirements of a PWA:

Uses a web manifest

Uses a service worker for offline functionality

Is installable

Presentation Requirements
Your group will give a 10-minute presentation on your project, with about 7 minutes devoted to the 
presentation itself, followed by a 3-minute Question & Answer session. Use this Project Presentation 
	Template (Links to an external site.) to address the following:
	Elevator pitch: A one-minute description of your application.
	Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
	Process: 
		What technologies did you use? 
		How did you break down and assign tasks and roles? 
		What challenges did you encounter? 
		What were your successes?

Demo: Show your stuff!

Directions for future development.

SO- THE SET UP FOR DEEP THOUGHTS SHOULD BE APPLIED TO START-BEIN:

SET-UP GRAPH QL QUERIES

SET-UP MUTATIONS AND JWT LOGIC
AS A USER I CAN CREATE MY OWN ACCOUNT AND LOGIN
AS A LOGGED-IN USER, I CAN CREATE AND REACT TO THOUGHTS AND ADD FRIENDS
